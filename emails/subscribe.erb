Dear <%=name%>,

This email is to confirm that we've received your payment and your London
Hackspace membership is now active. We're very grateful for your support!

Before you start using the space, you should make sure that you're familiar
with our rules:

  http://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Rules

We also recommend that you join our mailing list in order to keep up to date
with the goings-on at London Hackspace:

To get 24-hour access, you'll need to register your Oyster card (or other
similar RFID card). The easiest way to do this is to visit the space during a
busy time (Tuesdays or weekends) and ask a friendly member to help you add
your card.

Once your card is added, you'll be able to access the Hackspace at any time.
Outside of busy periods, our front shutter may be closed. To get access, you'll
need to come in through the rear gate using the code available on our site:

Thanks,

The London Hackspace trustees
