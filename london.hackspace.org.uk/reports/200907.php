<h2>Hackspace Foundation report &mdash; July 2009</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The big news this month is that we 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/london-hack-space/browse_thread/thread/c345a1f5bb2164b4">now have a space</a> 
- it's not ideal but it's a great start. 
The space is costing us £400/month (which is a steal).<p>

<p>You can see that even though we have double the expenses this month, our net income is 
still pleasingly positive. This is in part due to the surplus of about £180 we made on our 
latest hack evening, although it's worth noting that our expenditure on drink was less
than it should have been due to the Guardian generously sending us some free beer.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in hackspace-land, we're now aware of ten hacker space projects in the UK, all of which
started up since we did in January.</p>

<p>I'm not publishing the website stats on these monthly reports now because they're 
fiddly to do and I don't have the time.</p>
